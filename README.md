## Architect: F-Algebra

A great [introduction to F-algebras](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2013/06/10/understanding-f-algebras/) was posted by Bartosz Milewski. 

This is a small part of a project called Architect, which suppose to help Dotty programmers to get rid of a big piece of boilerplate.

The library is a higher kinds version of [an algebra library](https://github.com/garrynsk/algebra).

The library also containts traits describing algebraic structures in a categorial theoretic sense. Such as:

CategoryF
SemicategoryF
SemigroupF
MonoidF
GroupoidF
GroupF
RingF
and others.
